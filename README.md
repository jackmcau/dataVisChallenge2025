# dataVisChallenge2025
Attempt at the data visualization challenge from CU Boulder for 2025


## Idea
My idea for interpreting this data is to create a 3d environment in Unity which takes all of the tree data and randomly generates trees based off of it. These will be put around a virtual low poly campus in which you can look at each individual tree and see its data compared to the summarized data. I hope to be able to implement interactive data plots where you can click an individual plot point and it will take you to the tree it represents.
